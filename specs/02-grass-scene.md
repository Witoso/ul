## Goal
Show a grass background when the Start button is clicked.

## Requirements
- Clicking Start transitions to a new scene that shows `grass.png` as a tiled background.
- Pressing Escape returns to the main menu.

## Out of Scope
- Player movement or gameplay.
- Additional UI beyond the grass background.

## Notes
- Use `public/assets/grass.png` as the tile texture.
