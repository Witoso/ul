# 01 Main Menu

## Goal
Create a simple main menu screen with the title "UL" and a Start button.

## Requirements
- Replace any existing title text in the menu with "UL".
- Show a Start button below the title.
- The Start button does nothing for now (no scene change or action).

## Out of Scope
- Any gameplay changes.
- Button hover/press effects beyond default styling.

## Notes
- Keep it kid friendly and visually simple.
